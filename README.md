# MLDL-Project

This repository contains the implementation of all the experiments and results presented in the report, covering the **centralized**, **federated**, and **personal contribution** settings.

The experiments are implemented in the following Colab notebooks:

- `centralized_finalversion.ipynb` – Centralized training
- `federated_finalversion.ipynb` – Federated learning training
- `attacks_finalversion.ipynb` – Personal contribution part

## How to Reproduce the Results

1. **Initial Setup**  
   For each notebook, start by running all the cells related to:
   - Package imports
   - Dataset and model preparation
   - Function definitions
   - Mask computation 

2. **Run Specific Experiments**  
   After setup, execute the cells whose heading corresponds to the experiment you want to reproduce. These sections include the specific results and plots.
